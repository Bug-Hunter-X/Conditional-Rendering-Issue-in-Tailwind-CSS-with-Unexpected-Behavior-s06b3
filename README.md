# Conditional Rendering Issue in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using conditional rendering with Tailwind CSS.  The issue involves the disappearance of a conditionally rendered element when specific Tailwind classes are applied to its parent or sibling elements.  The root cause seems to be related to the order and conflict of certain Tailwind directives, particularly with flexbox.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run  `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the behavior of the red div.  Notice it disappears if you add additional classes and play with flexbox classes in the parent div. 

## Solution

The solution is provided in `MyComponentSolution.js`, and focuses on ensuring proper wrapping and layout of the elements to resolve the conflict between the conditional rendering and Tailwind classes. Key changes include wrapping the elements with a div and ensuring that the order of classes makes sense within Tailwind's expected layout.

This bug highlights the importance of careful styling and structural considerations when working with Tailwind CSS, particularly with conditional rendering and flexbox layouts.
